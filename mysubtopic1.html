      <h4 style="color: black">You can think of the part of speech as how a word functions in meaning and how it functions grammatically within an sentence. As an analogy, think of the ingredients of a sandwich. The onions, tomatoes, and meat, all add their respective flavors to the sandwich. In the same way, each individual word brings its own taste and function to a sentence. Where it gets tricky, however, is when a word has more than one part of speech. For simplicity, however, for now we’ll have to sacri-fries these types of words and save them for later! For now, a basic introduction to the parts of speech.

    <div title="POS1" id="Nouns">
      <h3 title="POS">Nouns</h3>
      <p>A noun is a word that names or identifies a specific set of or a single person, place, thing or idea. Nouns can also name qualities, emotions, and activities.
        There are many different types of nouns from proper nouns abstract nouns to count nouns.
        A complete and explained list of the type of nouns can be found <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/types-of-noun/">here</a>. Examples of nouns are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Queen</li>
        <li>Sandwhiches</li>
        <li>Pen</li>
        <li>David</li>
        <li>Hope</li>
        <li>Table</li>
        <li>Lunch</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div title="POS1" id="Pronouns">
      <h3 title="POS">Pronouns</h3>
      <p>A pronoun is used in place of a noun or noun phrase. Pronouns can be a subject, direct object, indirect object -- pretty much anything a noun can be! Without pronouns, the same nouns would continue to be repeated, thus making our speech and writing repetitive. Pronouns are short words that can avoid making communication cumbersome. So while they are not absolutely necessary to use, they are used very often and should be mastered. Like nouns, however, there are many types of pronouns and a complete list and exercises can be found <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/internet-grammar/nouns/pronoun.htm">here</a>. Examples of pronouns are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>He</li>
        <li>She</li>
        <li>They</li>
        <li>We</li>
        <li>It</li>
        <li>Who</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div title="POS1" id="Adjectives">
      <h3 title="POS">Adjectives</h3>
      <p style="color: Black">An adjective modifies a noun or pronoun. An adjective can describe, elaborate, or provide more information on a noun or pronoun.
        You can think of adjectives as the dressing of a sandwich. The sandwich is the noun and what elborates sandwich -- the sesame seeds, the crips bread, added flavor -- are like the adjectives.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Big</li>
        <li>Happy</li>
        <li>Yellow</li>
        <li>Delicious</li>
        <li>Crazy</li>
        <li>Colorful</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div title="POS1" id="Verbs">
      <h3 title="POS">Verbs</h3>
      <p style="color:black">A verb shows an action -- what someone or something is doing. There are three types of verbs: action, linking, and helping verbs.
        An explanation of each of these types of verbs can be found <a href="https://www.uvu.edu/writingcenter/docs/handouts/grammar/typesofverbs.pdf">here</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go</li>
        <li>Run</li>
        <li>Eat</li>
        <li>Study</li>
        <li>Live</li>
        <li>Walk</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div title="POS1" id="Adverbs">
      <h3 title="POS">Adverbs</h3>
      <p>An adverb modifies a verb. A good way to think about it is that an adverb tells you how, where, when, or how someone or something completes an action.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Slowly</li>
        <li>Quietly</li>
        <li>Happily</li>
        <li>Always</li>
        <li>Tomorrow</li>
        <li>Never</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div title="POS1" id="Prepositions">
      <h3 title="POS">Prepositions</h3>
      <p>  A preposition is a part of speech to understand.
        Formally, a preposition shows the relationship of a noun or pronoun to another word.
        But the best way to understand prepositions is to use the caterpillar and apple example.
        <a href="https://www.english-grammar-revolution.com/what-is-a-preposition.html"> Elizabeth O'Brien</a> does a great job of explaining this model.
        Prepositions are used to indicate a time, place, or relationship. Examples are as follows:
      </p>
      <img src="images\apple.jpg" alt="Onions">
      <ul>
        <li>Slowly</li>
        <li>Quietly</li>
        <li>Happily</li>
        <li>Always</li>
        <li>Tomorrow</li>
        <li>Never</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div title="POS1" id="Conjunctions">
      <h3 title="POS">Conjunctions</h3>
      <p>A conjunction links or joins together two words, ideas, phrases or clauses together -- you can think of conjunctions as the bread that holds everything together.
        Different types of conjunctions link different parts of a sentence together. For example, coordinating conjunctions join two or more sentences together. Examples are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>And</li>
        <li>Or</li>
        <li>But</li>
        <li>Because</li>
        <li>Yet</li>
        <li>Since</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div title="POS1" id="interjections">
      <h3 title="POS">Interjections</h3>
      <p>Interjections are words that show the emotion (usually strong emotion) or feeling of the writer.
        Interjections are not grammatically related to any other part of the sentence, however, they still are important to know because of their ability to express sudden emotions such as surprise, joy, or anger. Interjections are usually found at the beginning of the sentence. Examples are as follows:
        Examples are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yeah</li>
        <li>Boo</li>
        <li>Eh</li>
        <li>Aah</li>
        <li>Hmmm</li>
        <li>Whoa</li>
      </ul>
