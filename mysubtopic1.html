    <h3><a href="index.html">The Yellow Sub</a> Teaches the Basic Parts of Speech</h3>
    <img src="images\yellowsub.png">
    <h2>Hello All!! In most languages, including the English language, there are eight basic ingredients:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Nouns</li>
      <li>Pronouns</li>
      <li>Verbs</li>
      <li>Adjectives</li>
      <li>Adverbs</li>
      <li>Preposition</li>
      <li>Conjunctions</li>
      <li>Interjections</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>You can think of the part of speech as how the word functions in meaning and gramatically within an sentence.
      As an analogy, think of the ingredients of a sandwhich. The onions, tomatoes, and meat, all have their own taste and added flavor to the sandwhich.
      In the same way, each individual word brings its own taste and function a sentence.
      Where its tricky, however, is when a word has more than one part of speech. We'll explore these types of words later! For now, a basic introduction
      to the parts of speech </h4>
    <h3>Nouns</h3>
    <p>A noun is a word that names or identifies a specific set of or a single person, place, thing or idea.
      There are many different types of nouns from proper nouns abstract nouns to count nouns. A complete and explained list
      of the type of nouns can be found <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/types-of-noun">here</a>.
      Examples of nouns are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Queen</li>
      <li>Sandwhiches</li>
      <li>Pen</li>
      <li>David</li>
      <li>Hope</li>
      <li>Table</li>
      <li>Lunch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pronouns</h3>
    <p>A pronoun is used in place of a noun or noun phrase. Pronouns can be a subject, direct object, indirect object -- pretty much anything a noun can be!
      Without pronouns, the same nouns would continue to be repeated, thus making our speech and writing repetitive.
      Pronouns are short words that can avoid making communication cumbersome. So while they are not absolutely necessary to use, they
      are used very often and should be mastered. Like nouns, however, there are many types of pronouns and a complete list and
      excercises can be found <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/internet-grammar/nouns/pronoun.htm">here</a>.
      Examples of pronouns are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>He</li>
      <li>She</li>
      <li>They</li>
      <li>We</li>
      <li>It</li>
      <li>Who</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Adjectives</h3>
    <p>An adjective modifies a noun or pronoun. An adjective describe, elaborate, or provide more information on a noun or pronoun.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Big</li>
      <li>Happy</li>
      <li>Yellow</li>
      <li>Delicious</li>
      <li>Crazy</li>
      <li>Colorful</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Verbs</h3>
    <p>A verb shows an action -- what someone or something is doing. There are three types of verbs: action, linking, and helping verbs.
      An explanation of each of these types of verbs can be found <a href="https://www.uvu.edu/writingcenter/docs/handouts/grammar/typesofverbs.pdf">here</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go</li>
      <li>Run</li>
      <li>Eat</li>
      <li>Study</li>
      <li>Live</li>
      <li>Walk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Adverbs</h3>
    <p>An adverb modifies a verb. A good way to think about it is that an adverb
      tells you how, where, when, or how someone or something completes an action.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Slowly</li>
      <li>Quietly</li>
      <li>Happily</li>
      <li>Always</li>
      <li>Tomorrow</li>
      <li>Never</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Prepositions</h3>
    <p>A preposition is a part of speech to understand. Formally, a prepsoition shows the
      relationship of a noun or pronoun to another word. But the best way to understand prepositions is to use the caterpillar and apple example.
      <a href="https://www.english-grammar-revolution.com/what-is-a-preposition.html"> Elizabeth O'Brien</a> does a great job of explaining this model.
      Prepositions are used to indicate a time, place, or relationship. Examples are as follows:
    </p>
    <img src="images\apple.jpg">
    <ul>
      <li>Slowly</li>
      <li>Quietly</li>
      <li>Happily</li>
      <li>Always</li>
      <li>Tomorrow</li>
      <li>Never</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conjunctions</h3>
    <p>A conjunction links or joins together two words, ideas, phrases or clauses together. Examples are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>And</li>
      <li>Or</li>
      <li>But</li>
      <li>Because</li>
      <li>Yet</li>
      <li>Since</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interjections</h3>
    <p>Interjections are words that show the emotion (usually strong emotion) or feeling of the writer.
      They usually included at the start of a sentence to express feelings such as surprise, joy, or anger.
      Examples are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Yeah</li>
      <li>Boo</li>
      <li>Eh</li>
      <li>Aah</li>
      <li>Hmmm</li>
      <li>Whoa</li>
    </ul>
