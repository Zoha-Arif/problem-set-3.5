      Learning a language and its grammar is a learning journey which allows you, by the end of it, to understand others and to form connections. The language learning journey has a kind of natural beauty to it that allows you to flourish as learner. The best way to enhance your learning process is to become inspired to study harder in spare moments by perhaps picking up a book and falling into its smooth rhythm or holding conversation with a native speaker. Be proactive and want to comprehend what native speakers in movies and real life are talking about and exchange language with them. Holding a conversation with a native speaker is perhaps the best way to enhance your language skills. Too often, people spend all of their time studying grammar and memorizing lists of words instead of actually going out there and putting what they've learned into practice. (But that doesn’t mean that you should click out of this website and quit reading about grammar in a sandwich-oriented environment. By all means, finish reading this page and then connect with a native speaker!) Speaking with a real, live person will help you to feel much more motivated about learning the language than staring at a book or computer screen.
      <br/>
      <br/> I would recommend that you study the language and its grammar everyday and carry a dictionary wherever you go to save yourself from the frustration of the moment when you can’t find the right word to express yourself in the manner of which you would like. And, finally, immerse yourself in the language. Watch television shows and movies and read books for these published mediums at the utmost representation of good grammar and communication skills. Immerse yourself in such a way that you can do all the activities you would normally do in your new language. Listen to a TED Ed Talk, look at the EG English Grammar Guide, do whatever is that you deem necessary to hone and immerse yourself in grammar.

      <br/>When things may seem hard, remember that forgetting to meat your own interests is mi-steak. Unless you are currently being forced to read about English grammar, don’t sacri-fries time you may be able to spend doing other extracurriculars you enjoy by learning a language that you have no interest in. But if you truly do have to or want to learn about grammar for whatever reason that may be, make up your mind to enjoy comedy and drama of that language. One native Chinese speaker began to play English video games and as he did this not only did his vocabulary expand along with the number of games he played, but he was able to enjoy english culture better and slowly improve his grammatical skills.
      <br/>
      <br/>Whatever it may be, however, always remember that learning is about the journey so have a good laugh while reading this punny website and stay motivated! :)
