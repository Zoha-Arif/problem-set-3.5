    <h2>Punctuation & Forming Sentences</h2>
    <h3>Taught by <a href="index.html">Hot Dog Joe</a></h3>

    <p>In any language, punctuation marks are extremely important in giving intended meaning to the language.
      In fact, using the wrong punctuation can completely change the meaning of the sentence or turn the message into nonsense.
    Therefore, it is important that we study the exact use of each punctuation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Periods: A period mark is used for declarative sentences and some
        imperative sentences that do not convey strong emotion or points.
       </li>
      <li>Exclamation Points: Used for interjections and exclamatory sentences and at the end of strong
        imperative sentences.
      </li>
      <li>Question Marks: Used at the end of all interrogative sentences and incomplete interrogative sentences (incomplete or complete.)
      </li>

    <h3>How to form Sentences</h3>
    <p>The best way to master writing sentences in English is to practice original sentence structure daily.
      As a general rule of thumb, avoid the passive voice and wealer words like "I think" and "probably."
      Proofreading and rewriting is key because, in the end, writing is rewriting. <br/>
      In English, the most common order for parts of a sentence is subject, verb, object (if present).</p>
    <p>
      Even the most complicated sentences begin with the simple subject predicate structure
      so knowing the basic parts of a sentence is essential to forming proper sentences.
      A sentence has a subject (the person, place or thing that the sentence is about) and a predict,
      which contains the verb (what action the subject is doing).
      After the simple subject predicate sentences, some sentences have objects, whoever or whatever the action is being done to.
      These three elements combine to form one cohesive sentence.
    </p>
    <h3>Active vs. Passive Voice</h3>
    <p><b>Active Voice:</b>the subject of sentence performs the action.</p>
    <p><b>Passive Voice:</b>the subject receives the action.</p>
