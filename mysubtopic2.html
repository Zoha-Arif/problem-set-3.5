    <p>In any language, punctuation marks are extremely important in giving intended meaning to the language. In fact, using the wrong punctuation can completely change the meaning of the sentence or turn the message into nonsense. But loads of people hate punctuation, and don't know why we should put in the time to learn how to use them correctly and understand their general purpose. But, truly, you must think of punctuation as a friend who allows your writing be clear by ensuring that the meaning is understandable to the reader. Therefore, it is important that we study the exact use of each punctuation.
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Periods: A period mark is used for declarative sentences and some
        imperative sentences that do not convey strong emotion or points.
       </li>
      <li>Exclamation Points: Used for interjections and exclamatory sentences and at the end of strong
        imperative sentences.
      </li>
      <li>Question Marks: Used at the end of all interrogative sentences and incomplete interrogative sentences (incomplete or complete.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="titleof">How to form Sentences</h3>
    <p>The best way to master writing sentences in English is to practice original sentence structure daily.  As a general rule of thumb, avoid the passive voice and wealer words like "I think" and "probably." The passive voice is the death of words because the active voice, in most cases, sounds better and conveys emotion and activities better. The passive voice is often seen as lazy writing and is used for less strategic instances. Proofreading and rewriting is key because, in the end, writing is rewriting. In English, one of the most important things to keep in mind is that the most accepted order for parts of a sentence is subject, verb, object (if present). Even the most complicated sentences begin with the simple subject predicate structure so knowing the basic parts of a sentence is essential to forming proper sentences. A sentence has a subject (the person, place or thing that the sentence is about) and a predict, which contains the verb (what action the subject is doing). After the simple subject predicate sentences, some sentences have objects, whoever or whatever the action is being done to. These three elements combine to form one cohesive sentence.
    <br/>
    <br/> Furthermore, to write coherently in English, you should be simple whenever you can be and avoid trying to sound “fancy” by stuffing your sentences with massive flamboyant words. Instead, focus on one idea and develop a breezy style of writing. A lot of newer writers believe that in order to be taken seriously, they need lengthy complex sentences full of subordinate clauses and information offset by commas. Resist this temptation because simple is sometimes everything. That’s the reasoning behind why we sometimes would rather go for a simple peanut butter and jelly sandwich then a BLT.
    <br/>
    <br/> The best way, however, to improve in writing is to be open to criticism from yourself and from others, if that means hiring a professional editor of having your trusty friend or sibling look over your draft. These peer critics will make you a stronger writer as plot holes and ineffective writing that you may not have noticed before may spring up.

    <p><b>Active Voice:</b>the subject of sentence performs the action.</p>
    <p><b>Passive Voice:</b>the subject receives the action.</p>
